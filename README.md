## Introduction

Movies are fascinating worldwide, and a movieâ€™s genre is one of the most interesting aspects. How do
genres relate to movie plots, cast/crew, and posters? These are questions that a movie buff, industry
reviewer, or data scientist might wonder about. With modern deep learning software and GPU
hardware, opportunities exist to pair curiosity and technology for interesting, informal research.

In the research domain, substantial effort has been devoted to deep learning techniques and parallel
processing hardware. At the same time, these areas are largely new to the average computer-science
student. In this project, we explore the genre question above using classic machine learning and modern
deep learning techniques. Our deep learning was supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
